# Quantum_Computing

Sample program on quantum computing using Qiskit. 2 qbit register demonstration on IBMQ. 
Steps involving: 
1. initiation of 2 qbits to simulate if - else - then conditon and 2 classical bits to measure the result out of it. 
2. create 2 qbit operation , this 2 qbit operation is like logical if. quantum version of if - else - then
   control is present in first qbit while target will be there in second qbit.
3. simulate the qunatum circuit on local laptop by aer component.
4. Execute the circuit on ibmq_vigo backend.
