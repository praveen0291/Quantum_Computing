# Quantum_Computing

Sample program on quantum computing using Qiskit. 2 qbit register demonstration on IBMQ. 
Steps involving: 
1. initiation of 2 qbits to simulate if - else - then conditon and 2 classical bits to measure the result out of it. 
2. create 2 qbit operation , this 2 qbit operation is like logical if. quantum version of if - else - then
   control is present in first qbit while target will be there in second qbit.
3. simulate the qunatum circuit on local laptop by aer component.
4. Execute the circuit on ibmq_vigo backend. 


# Quantum computing basic building blocks

 Circuit model is being used for quantum computing becasue, any other computation model like turning machine which is methamatical
 model of computation that defined a machine which manupulate symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules to determine
 a result from a set of input variables , has to be in coherent superposition where the heads have to be on differet places 
 along with tape. This is somthing near to impossible to achieve with exiting technology although physics permit it to do so. 
 So on other hand , circuit model, with bunch of quantum bits in coherent superposition with each other & applying gates
 to pair of quantum bits. 
 circuit model is designed to process finite inputs , circuit model does'nt work if there is input independent of size. 





# Quantum Gates : 
 There are 4 presentation to represent quantum gates. 


 - Bra-Ket notation
 - Matrix representation
 - Bloch sphere picture
 - Measurement results
